## Content Insights

I learnt that PHP is an open source server-side scripting language. Also, it is widely used for web development. It is compatible with major operating systems such as Linux, Microsoft Windows, and macOS. PHP, as a server-side scripting language, is capable of handling requests, organising databases, and is used in conjunction with HTML to enable developers to perform server-side operations while presenting HTML to the user.Its advantages include ease of learning, versatility (for creating blogs, e-commerce websites, social media, etc.), rich support and documentation, fast execution speeds, and open source and free features make it an affordable web development option.

I also learnt, how to convert HTML files to PHP files by simply changing the file extension. The video highlights the basic syntax of PHP, especially how to use PHP tags ( and ) to mark up blocks of PHP code. In addition, I learnt how to write and test PHP code properly, for example using commands to output text. Finally, I learnt that in order to run PHP code, you must have a web server, such as a local WAMP server or an integrated development environment in the cloud. Without a proper server configuration, the browser will not be able to execute the PHP code and will only display it as plain text.



## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

By learning the meaning and usage of PHP, I have gained a deeper understanding and plan for my future career path and career development. Firstly, as a widely used server-side scripting language, PHP provides me with valuable skills to enter the field of web development. Mastering PHP means that I am able to participate in building and maintaining dynamic websites and applications, which is in high demand in the current fast-developing Internet era.

Secondly, learning PHP has not only improved my technical skills, it has also developed my ability in logical thinking, problem solving and innovation. In the process of writing and optimising code, I learnt how to solve problems more effectively, which is crucial for any career development.

In addition, understanding PHP and its role in real-world applications has made me more aware of the importance of continually learning new technologies. The field of technology is constantly changing and I must constantly update my knowledge base to keep up with the ever-changing demands of the industry.

In my future career, I plan to not only limit myself to PHP, but also explore other programming languages and technologies such as JavaScript, Python, etc. in order to more fully adapt to different project needs and work environments. Such diversified skills will make me more competitive and adaptable in the workplace.

In conclusion, learning PHP is an important starting point in my career, which not only enhances my technical skills but also lays a solid foundation for my future career development. I look forward to applying this knowledge in real projects by creating valuable solutions.
